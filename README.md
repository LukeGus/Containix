# Overview
Containix is a list of popular self-hosted Docker compose files. This repo stands as a storage place for said compose files, and is used in the "Compose Store" feature of my project [Dashix]("https://dashix.dev").

# How to contribute?

Containix is almost entirely run by the community. To add your self-hosted service to the list, create a GitHub [Issue]("https://github.com/LukeGus/Containix/issues") with the following template:
```
### Service Name
[Insert the name of the service youâ€™re submitting, e.g. nginx, redis]

### Example docker-compose.yml
[Paste a working example of the docker-compose.yml config for this service]

### Documentation or references
[Add links to the official docs, Docker Hub page, or GitHub repo]

### Notes
[Any other context or setup instructions]
```
Before submitting a compose file, ensure the following are true:
- All comments in the file have been removed
- Unnecessary ports, environment variables, etc., have been removed
- The Docker image is publicly available to pull
- All environment variables should be included within the text, not within a .env file
- If possible, use the `latest` tag for the image
- Multiple services within one compose are fine, as long as they are related/required for them to work
- Replace external volume paths with descriptive all-caps placeholders indicating their purpose. For example, change `/data/adguard-home/work:/opt/adguardhome/work` to `/WORK_DIR:/opt/adguardhome/work`
- Set default timezone to `Etc/UTC`
